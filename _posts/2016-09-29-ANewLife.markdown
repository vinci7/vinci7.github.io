Today , I attend tsukuba university’s orientation for exchange student, there are plenty of students from all around the world, but the tsukuba’s professor have a strong Japanese accent, even though his speaking is simply, it’s a little hard to understand his meaning. But I don’t worried about that coz I have a responsible and handsome tutor, he always notice me what should I do.

And then, I join the college orientation with my tutor, the orientation is very short, just need to fill a simply form and hand it in.

Tomorrow I will attend the Japanese course orientation, there’s so many orientations, and then I will join the seminar of my OSSS laboratory, I feel a little nervous when I think about that, but I must to face it, so I will prepare my self-introduction in advance.

Wish everything goes well tomorrow!
