Today, I attend tsukuba university’s orientation for exchange student, there are plenty of students from all around the world. The professor at the university of tsukuba speaks in strong Japanese accent, even though what he said is easy, it’s a little hard to understand his meaning. But I don’t worry about that cos I have a responsible and handsome tutor, he always notices me what should I do.

And then, I attend the college orientation with my tutor, the orientation is very short, just need to fill a simple form and hand it in.

Tomorrow I will attend the Japanese course orientation, there are so many orientations, and then I will join the seminar of my OSSS laboratory, I feel a little nervous when I think about that, but I must face it, so I will prepare my self-introduction in advance.

Wish everything will be better tomorrow!
